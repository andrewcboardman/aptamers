This program is intended to take sequencing data from an aptamer binding experiment (see Arter et al, Anal. Chem., 2018, 90 (17), pp 10302â€“10310), process it to identify sequences that successfully bound, and train an Ising model on this data. It consists of three parts:

Part I: Quality control
This takes sequence data and removes low quality base pairs and primers

Part II: Encoding
This encodes each read as a set of spins (and possibly calculates correlations)

Part III: Model training
This trains an Ising model on the encoded data (using a mean-field approach)

Part IV: Prediction
This returns a suggested probability distribution to be used to generate new inputs (the marginal distribution for sequences that bind)
