This program is intended to take sequencing data from an aptamer binding experiment (see Arter et al, Anal. Chem., 2018, 90 (17), pp 10302â€“10310), process it to identify sequences that successfully bound, and train an Ising model on these data. It consists of three parts:

Part I: Pre-processing
Trim adaptors, remove low quality sequences
One-hot encode
Standardise
Optionally: Augment FASTA with shifted sequences

Part II: Model training
This trains a model on the encoded data 
options: 
Independent sites
Mean-field ising
Convolutional neural net
Fully-connected neural net

Part III: Validation
This visualises the results of the model training
Generate samples from model (and compare to originals)
Plot inferred coefficients on histogram
Evaluate the probabilities of a set of sequences coming from the model


Prediction
This returns a suggested probability distribution to be used to generate new inputs (the marginal distribution for sequences that bind)
